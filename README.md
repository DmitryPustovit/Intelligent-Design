IMPORTANT NOTICE: 
Merge with master is now blocked behind approval from DmitryPustovit. Merge requests Required! :D 
This is done to keep Heroku from throwing a massive fit everytime anyone gets active.
Proper branching system is to make a branch with the name convention:
user-release_version-IssueNumber-descriptor
EX: DmitryPustovit-PV_1-1-doc-updates



github: https://github.com/DmitryPustovit/Intelligent-Design

deployed at (cut and paste): aowolfie.com:5000

You will need to open the tools, color select, layers and brushes (Multicolored tiles).

Make sure you select a brush from the brush menu and the brush from the tools menu.

You may need to refresh the page once or twice in order for all resources to load correctly.
