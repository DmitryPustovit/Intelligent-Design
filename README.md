Tomo Editor
================================
The idea behind Tomo was to be an open, simple, powerful, community image editor.    
One of the core ideas was to be able to sync what is being drawn from multiple people.  
Tomo means friends, and Tomo Editor is a place where you can Draw, Edit, and Create with friends!  
  
    
	  
Tomo Editor is a project originally created for the final group project of a software engineering class.  
It was a bit more ambitious then we realized at the time.
