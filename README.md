Tomo Editor
================================
Tomo Editor is a project originally created for the final group project of a software engineering class  
The idea behind Tomo was to be an open, simple, powerful, community image editor  
One of the core ideas was to be able to sync what is being drawn from mutliple people  
Tomo means friends, and Tomo Editor is a place where you can Draw, Edit, and Create with friends!
